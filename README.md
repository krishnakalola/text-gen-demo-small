# Very Small Language Model

This repository contains a [Streamlit](http://www.streamlit.io) app that can be used
to demonstrate some concepts of generative language models.  It's called a "Very
Small Language Model" because of course much AI research and product development
today is centered around Large Language Models (LLMs) and while this demo can show
some of the important concepts that show up in any predictive text model, it is
far, far smaller than an LLM.
